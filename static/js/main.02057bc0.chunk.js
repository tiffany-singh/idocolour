This is a song that somehow feels both familiar and fresh at the same time, the choppy, almost quirky beats, the deep, resonant bass, and masterfully placed layering lends this track to feel like something that would be heard in a late night/early morning, smoky bar or on a futuristic sci-fi movie soundtrack. The vocal samples are gorgeous, perfectly positioned in the mix to be simultaneously haunting, beautiful, and to capture a sense of mysteriousness.\u201d\n\n"Second track, Guadyte\u2019s Lair, is where we begin to see Steven Hue\u2019s confident and competent move into atmospheric/ambient music. This type of music is best enjoyed with the lights off \u2013 and when you allow the music to be a storyteller, richly describing the scene to you. ~ muzic.net.nz\n\n\u201dThird and final track, Typhoon somehow nestles nicely in a midspot stylistically between Night Club Bar and Guadyte\u2019s Lair. Starting with a series of droning synth layers, Typhoon teases at being another ambient soundscape similar to Guadyte\u2019s Lair before shattering its own mold by introducing the vocals and dub-esque bass swells.\u201d ~ muzic.net.nz',media:[{id:1,url:"https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1360607029&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"}]},brainstare_manatorquim:{image:"brain-manny-gradient_01_2K.16.9.jpg",title:"Brainstare / Manatorquim",subtitle:"In November 2021, Steven Hue made his solo debut with two genre bending tracks.",copy:'Building on his experience composing and performing with Full Code, Hue setout to blend heavy experimental rock with electronic sounds associated with electronica and drum \u2018n bass.\n\nAfter several years of development in electronic music production and sound design, Hue engaged producer Dan Murtagh to bring Brainstare and Manatorquim to life.\n\nVocals, guitar, and drums were recorded at Debasement Studios in Melbourne.

The track [Brainstare] feels like it falls apart, while also somehow remaining cohesive. The drumbeat that has propelled the song, the synth lines, the hooks, all drop into strange, angular, sharp edges. There is no simple toe-tap beat anymore, but instead a full world of sound and time to explore.\u201d ~ muzic.net.nz\n\n"From the slow-burn intro, the held-back drumming, subdued-almost-hushed vocal delivery, and the sparse but effective use of sax/horns, this track [Manatorquim] is a masterclass in the adage of \u201cthe whole is greater than the sum of the parts.\u201d Momentum is built, and maintained, by the slow, but near constant development of tension of increasing instrument layers or intensity, which serves the track very well \u2013 leading to a satisfying climatic ending.\u201d ~ muzic.net.nz',media:[{id:1,url:"https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1345436335&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"}]},fullcode:{image:"fullcode_bg.jpg",title:"Full Code",subtitle:"Steven Hue is the former vocalist and co-writer for experimental rock band Full Code",copy:'Formed in 2005, Full Code was the union of four disparate souls who began to find themselves and each other while studying at the Nelson School of Music.\n\nDrawing from the member\u2019s divergent influences, the band\u2019s exciting fusion of prog/psych rock, metal sensibility, and an incredible live expression of drum and bass, replacing sequencing and sampling with live drum breaks and guitar-generated synths, wowed crowds at venues throughout New Zealand.\n\nPraise came thick and fast for Full Code\u2019s lush sonic landscapes that stretch unhindered over densely forested plains bearing unexpected fruit for the mind, heart and soul.

Hue\u2019s role was to compose and produce seven loopable soundscapes to correlate with the chakras and their colours. Participants could choose a colour and listen to the corresponding soundscape via a web application.\n\nHue researched the ideology that chakras are energised by specific musical notes, and that various musical instruments resonate with each chakra. As healing and wellbeing are integral themes of Singh\u2019s work, abrasive sounds and timbres were not appropriate for this sonic palette.\n\nPaying close attention to these parameters, Hue assigned notes and instruments to the seven soundscapes accordingly, for example, the note for the exquisite \u201cHeart\u201d soundscape is F# and its dominant instrument is the piano.\n\nTo add variance between the soundscapes, Hue used a different tempo for each chakra; the beats per minute increased from the \u201cRoot\u201d to the \u201cCrown\u201d. Hue used an array of sampled instruments, including: tabla, dhol, tanpura, violin, cello, piano, harpsichord, bassoon, clarinet, saxophone and flute. Hue also recorded his voice and acoustic guitar.\n\nThe installation premiered at Te Papa in March 2018 and is currently still on show.

The artwork aimed to humanise the politicisation of immigration within New Zealand.\n\nHue\u2019s accompanying score had to resonate with the storyteller\u2019s almost tangible emotions, and needed to play continuously throughout the exhibition as a single looping track without seeming repetitive. A further technical requirement was for the recorded narrations to be mixed with the score, alongside excerpts from broadcast media.\n\nHue perceived common emotional themes that connected each of the narrator\u2019s stories: sadness, anxiety and hope. Thus inspired, Hue composed three separate movements that together comprised an emotive ambient score.\n\nHue used a minor chord progression to evoke sadness, which was accentuated with slow saxophone and filtered piano drenched in reverb. Hope was portrayed with a mix of warm synthetic bass, acoustic double bass, foley recordings, and layered violin. Hue manifested anxiety with sparse motifs, aggressive, staccato mid-range bass, and volume-automated hi-hats that simulated train travel to evoke a sense of journey and transitional change, which were key themes of Singh\u2019s installation.\n\nHue performed one of the narrations at the eleventh hour when it was discovered the original recording was unusable. The finished file came in at around two hours in length.\n\nThe project was completed within Singh\u2019s six-week deadline.
